The AutoComplete System allows users to type words in a search box and receive live suggestions instantly, powered by a Trie data structure for fast prefix-based search. Users can navigate suggestions using keyboard arrows or by clicking on them, and selected suggestions automatically populate the input box. Additionally, new words can be dynamically added through the frontend, updating the system in real time.This feature set demonstrates both data structure efficiency and full-stack web development in a practical, live application.
